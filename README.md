Learned about the keywords in golang.
Go has 25 reserved keywords that are integral to its syntax and cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names). These keywords are categorized based on their usage:

1. Declaration Keywords

break,
case,
chan,
const,
continue,
default,
defer,
else,
fallthrough,
for,
func,
go,
goto,
if,
import,
interface,
map,
package,
range,
return,
select,
struct,
switch,
type,
var

These keywords are essential for defining control flow, data structures, and program behavior in Go.
